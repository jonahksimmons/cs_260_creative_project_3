	BOB is a bureaucracy where all Officially Operating Government Assets (OOGAs) are appointed by the Head of the State (HOTS). The HOTS is also appointed by the previous HOTS and there are no elections whatsoever. The HOTS also can create any number of reglatory agencies or appoint any OOGAs at will but cannot disband or fire any, no matter how old or obscure, without abiding by the Tediously Long Dismantling Restrictions (TLDR). This is totally to balance power and for no other reason.

	The current list of departments, managed by B^2, is as follows:

	<ul id="bureau_list">
		<li>Bureau of Bureaus (B^2)</li>
		<li>Bureau of Official Recommendations and Initiating Non-trivial Guides (BORING)</li>
		<li>Bureau Establishing Poor Intelectual Standards (BEPIS)</li>
		<li>Bureau of Investigating Non-Good Ubiquitous Scandals (BINGUS)</li>
		<li>Bureau of Energizing Economic Progress (BEEP)</li>
		<li>Bureau Overseeing Official Parties (BOOP)</li>
		<li>Bureau of Left-handed Mamals (BLM)</li>
		<li>Department of Government Yachts (DOGY)</li>
		<li>Department of Watches (DW)</li>
		<li>Department Of Official Flags (DOOF)</li>
	</ul>
		<p class="summary">The official flag for BOB (managed by DOOF) is represented by an approximation of the fibonacci sequence, which is given by the following equation:</p>
		<div class="equation">
		<code>r(theta) = ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^theta / sqrt(5)</code>
		</div>
		<p class="summary">
		The equation is a more effeint means of storing it rather than an image file, which can be megabytes in size. This is too large and can have quality issues.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		There is no need for a bill of rights because there is no reason for OOGAs or the HOTS to follow such a thing. Any "rights" afforded to citizens are out of the good will or forgetfullness of OOGAs or the HOTS.
